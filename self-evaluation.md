# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

Pretty good at this point- it was very helpful to think that I'm essentially creating a mini set of code inbetween the 'do' and 'end' portions that followed the each function. 

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I think it felt fine. I didn't have trouble with the earlier exercises and this was a bit more difficult but I just tried to run a bunch of examples on my own in Repplit and was able to figure it out. Doing my own examples and seeing if I can predict the results has been superhelpful for ume. 

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

Of what we've covered thus far, I don't think there's anything I am having trouble with. 

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
